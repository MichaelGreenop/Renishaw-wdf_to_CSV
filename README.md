# Renishaw-wdf_to_CSV

This is a small desktop app that converts a Renishaw wdf. file into CSV. format.

Use:
- Pull/download the file (dependencies include tkinter, RenishawWire, os and numpy)
- Run the program and select the wdf. file you want to convert (the CSV should save in the same folder as the Renisham-wdf_to_CSV.py file
